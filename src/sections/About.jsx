                Greetings! I'm thrilled to welcome you to my corner of the
                digital universe. With over three years of professional software
                engineering experience, I've been on a journey to make the world
                a better place through software.

                Over the last few years, I've come to understand and appreciate
                a great breadth of software engineering: from intuitive UIs,
                scalable backend systems, to rapid development and deployment
                cycles, and team & project management. Despite the many
                different hats I've worn, my mandate has remained ultimately the
                sameâ€”to create software that is delightful to use and delightful
                to develop.

                As a self-taught developer, I welcome new challenges and I never
                stop learning. In fact, growth mindset is an approach that I
                apply not just to software engineering, but also on the tennis
                courts ðŸŽ¾ and in my home studio playing guitar ðŸŽ¸ and piano ðŸŽ¹.

                I'm excited to connect and collaborate on projects that make a
                difference. Let's turn ideas into reality together!
